**Project Summary: Airbnb NYC 2019 Data Analysis**

Airbnb is a global online marketplace that connects property owners (hosts) with travelers seeking short-term accommodations. Operating in over 220 countries and more than 100,000 cities, Airbnb has significantly transformed the hospitality industry by offering flexible lodging options worldwide.

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb’s New York City (NYC) listings from the year 2019. As one of the world's most iconic cities and a top tourist destination, NYC attracted approximately 66.6 million visitors in 2019 (source: Office of the New York State Comptroller), making it a prime location for short-term rentals.

Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key metrics that influence Airbnb property listings in NYC. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on thousands of listings, we aim to uncover insights related to:

Pricing trends across neighborhoods

Distribution of room types and availability

Host activity and popularity

Neighborhood-specific performance

Common patterns in listing names

Turnover and performance of top hosts

Approach
Using a structured data science workflow, we cleaned and transformed the dataset before visualizing various aspects of the listings. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the NYC Airbnb market landscape, highlighting areas of opportunity and potential concern.

Impact
The insights derived from this project can support strategic, data-driven decisions for various stakeholders at Airbnb, including:

Marketing – to target high-demand neighborhoods

Finance – to optimize pricing strategies

Operations & Product – to improve host engagement and customer experience

This analysis not only sheds light on Airbnb’s business dynamics in NYC but also demonstrates the value of data in understanding urban rental behavior and optimizing marketplace performance.
